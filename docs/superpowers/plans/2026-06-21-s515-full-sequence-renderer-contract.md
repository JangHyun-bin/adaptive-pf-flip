# S515 Full-Sequence Renderer Contract Handoff

## Goal

Promote the current S515/S552 visual candidate from a corrected GIF into a
reproducible renderer/backend contract that can be consumed frame-by-frame.

This is still a post-tonemap low-frequency correction path. It is not yet a
renderer-native volumetric water or material model. Its purpose is to make the
current best full48 visual candidate deterministic, inspectable, and executable
through the same contract boundary that a real backend renderer can later
replace.

## Completed Chain

- S552 selected the bounded raw-contrast T4 correction as the current full48
  visual candidate.
- S555 regenerated the same 48 corrected frames while writing per-frame runtime
  bindings:
  - `base_rgb`
  - `positive_delta_rgb`
  - `negative_delta_rgb`
  - `correction_mask`
- S556 published the S555 gallery through Cloudflare quick tunnel for live
  review.
- S557 converted the S555 sequence summary into
  `lsfs_mitsuba_low_frequency_renderer_acceptance_package`.
- S558 built and validated a full48 renderer job manifest.
- S559 executed the renderer job dry-run and reproduced all accepted references
  with zero image diff.
- S560 built backend scene descriptors from the renderer job manifest.
- S561 executed the descriptor-level backend dry-run with zero image diff.
- S562 executed the same descriptors through an external process stub with zero
  image diff and no process failures.
- S563 published the S562 backend process proof gallery through Cloudflare quick
  tunnel.
- S564 replaced the process stub with
  `tools/mitsuba_low_frequency_post_tonemap_backend.py`, preserving the same
  descriptor/process CLI while emitting a non-stub backend result schema.
- S565 published the S564 post-tonemap backend proof gallery through Cloudflare
  quick tunnel.
- S566 compared S562 and S564 and confirmed identical GIF SHA256/byte size.

## Current Meaning

The current full48 visual result is no longer just a generated artifact. It is
now reproducible through:

1. a per-frame texture binding contract,
2. a renderer job manifest,
3. backend scene descriptors,
4. a process-level execution interface,
5. zero-diff validation against accepted references.

This gives the next renderer step a stable boundary. The first non-stub backend
is now in place and still produces the same accepted full48 visual output.

## Next

Move the same descriptor/process boundary toward renderer-native response:

1. Add a renderer-native response descriptor that maps the S515 low-frequency
   correction into material, light, or volume parameters instead of accepted
   post-tonemap deltas.
2. Generate a candidate Mitsuba XML export from that response descriptor.
3. Render a short sample through the real Mitsuba XML command adapter.
4. Compare the renderer-native sample against the S564 post-tonemap backend
   proof, and only promote it if it improves visual realism without breaking the
   current full48 contract gates.
